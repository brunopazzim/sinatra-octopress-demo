# Sinatra + Octopress Demo
This is a small app created to demonstrate how to integrate an Octopress blog as a subdirectory inside a Sinatra app.

1) Run ruby site.rb
2) Go to your browser and access the blog on localhost:4567/blog

You can acess a default page (which can be your website, a landing page or whatever) by going to localhost:4567
